# 3.6 set & setAttr methods

The `setAttr(String, Object)` method invokes `HttpServletRequest.setAttribute(String, Object)`. This method allows various data to be passed to the View and displayed in the View. By inspecting the JFinal source code of the `Controller`, it can be seen that the `setAttr(String, Object)` method internally just calls the underlying `HttpServletRequest` method:

```java
private HttpServletRequest request;
 
public Controller setAttr(String name, Object value) {
    request.setAttribute(name, value);
    return this;
}
```

**New in JFinal 3.6:** To further reduce the amount of code and increase development efficiency, JFinal 3.6 introduced the `set` method as a substitute for `setAttr`. Here's how to use it:

```java
set("article", article);
 
// Chaining usage
set("project", project).set("replyList", replyList).render("index.html");
```

JFinal's pursuit of reducing code, enhancing development efficiency, and lowering the learning curve is relentless.
