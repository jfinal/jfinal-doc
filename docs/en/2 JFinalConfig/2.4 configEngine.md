# 2.4 configEngine
This method is used to configure the Template Engine. Below is a code example:
```
public void configEngine(Engine me) {
    me.addSharedFunction("/view/common/layout.html");
    me.addSharedFunction("/view/common/paginate.html");
    me.addSharedFunction("/view/admin/common/layout.html");
}
```
The above method adds three template files, which define template functions, to the template engine. A more detailed introduction can be found in the Template Engine chapter.

Note: The configurations `me.setToClassPathSourceFactory()`, `me.setBaseTemplatePath(...)`, and `me.setDevMode(...)` should be placed at the beginning since the subsequent configurations like `me.addSharedFunction(...)` depend on these initial settings.

Starting from jfinal 4.9.02, a new configuration was added to support Chinese expressions, variable names, method names, and template function names:
```
Engine.setChineseExpression(true);
```
This configuration should be placed before `addSharedTemplateFunction(...)` and `addSqlTemplate(...)` to ensure it takes effect promptly. This setting is global and applies to all Engine instances.
