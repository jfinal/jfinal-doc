# 2.7 configHandler
This method is used to configure JFinal's Handler. The following code configures a handler named `ResourceHandler`. Handlers can take over all web requests and have complete control over the application, making it easy to implement higher-level functional extensions.
```
public void configHandler(Handlers me) {
    me.add(new ResourceHandler());
}
```
For specific usage, you can refer to the official implementations of several functionalities given in the jfinal source code: [https://gitee.com/jfinal/jfinal/tree/master/src/main/java/com/jfinal/ext/handler](https://gitee.com/jfinal/jfinal/tree/master/src/main/java/com/jfinal/ext/handler)
