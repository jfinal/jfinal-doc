# 5.1 Overview
Major Update: Starting from jfinal 3.0, a SQL management module has been added. It is much more enjoyable than using XML to manage SQL in mybatis. For a quick look, visit: http://www.jfinal.com/doc/5-13

ActiveRecord is one of the core components of JFinal. Operating the database through ActiveRecord will greatly reduce the amount of code and significantly improve development efficiency.

The essence of the ActiveRecord pattern is: a Model object uniquely corresponds to a record in a database table, and the correspondence relies on the primary key value of the database table.

Therefore, the ActiveRecord pattern requires the database table to have a primary key. When the database table doesn't have a primary key, you can only use the Db + Record mode to operate the database.
