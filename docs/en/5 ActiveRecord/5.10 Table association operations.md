# 5.10 Table Association Operations
JFinal ActiveRecord natively supports table association operations, so there is no need to learn anything newâ€”a classic case of "less is more." There are mainly two ways to perform table association operations: First, directly use SQL to get associated data; Second, add methods in the Model to fetch associated data.

Suppose there are two database tables: `user` and `blog`, and there is a one-to-many relationship from `user` to `blog`. The `blog` table uses `user_id` to associate with the `user` table. The following code demonstrates how to use the first method to get `user_name`:

```java
public void relation() {
  String sql = "select b.*, u.user_name from blog b inner join user u on b.user_id=u.id where b.id=?";
  Blog blog = Blog.dao.findFirst(sql, 123);
  String name = blog.getStr("user_name");
}
```

The code below demonstrates the second method for retrieving the associated `User` in `Blog` and the associated `Blog` in `User`:

```java
public class Blog extends Model<Blog>{
    public static final Blog dao = new Blog().dao();
    
    public User getUser() {
       return User.dao.findById(get("user_id"));
    }
}
 
public class User extends Model<User>{
    public static final User dao = new User().dao();
    
    public List<Blog> getBlogs() {
       return Blog.dao.find("select * from blog where user_id=?", get("id"));
    }
}
```

The above code creates a new `dao` object within the specific Model; this usage is solely for table association operations. For other cases, the `dao` object should be held by the Service layer.
