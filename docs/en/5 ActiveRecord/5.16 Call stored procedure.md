# 5.16 Calling Stored Procedures

The `Db` utility class makes it easy to call stored procedures. Below is a code example:

```java
Db.execute((connection) -> {
    CallableStatement cs = connection.prepareCall(...);
    cs.setObject(1, ...);
    cs.setObject(2, ...);
    cs.execute();
    cs.close();
    return cs.getObject(1);
});
```

As shown above, you can easily call a stored procedure using `Db.execute(...)`. The `connection` is an object of type `Connection`. After you are done using it, you don't need to call `close()` on it, as JFinal will automatically close it for you at the higher level.

Moreover, under MySQL, you can use an even simpler way to call stored procedures:

```java
// Call stored procedure to query the salary table
Record first = Db.findFirst("CALL FindSalary (1,\"201901\")");

// Call stored procedure to insert into the salary table
int update2 = Db.update("CALL InsertSalary (3, 123)");

// Call stored procedure to update the salary table
int update = Db.update("CALL UpdateSalary (3, 99999)");

// Call stored procedure to delete from the salary table
int delete = Db.delete("CALL DeleteSalary(3)");
```

These examples demonstrate how to execute various database operations—select, insert, update, and delete—by calling stored procedures in MySQL. The code is quite straightforward and takes advantage of JFinal's `Db` utility class for simplifying the operations.
