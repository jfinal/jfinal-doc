Capabilities of JBolt:

Overall, JBolt provides the ability to visually configure a development environment, automatically import dependent libraries, auto-generate configuration files, and launch the generated project with a single click.

1. Based on the configuration information from the project creation wizard, you can one-click generate a JFinal project development environment. This supports the generation of regular dynamic Web projects and Maven projects. It also automatically imports dependent jar packages, generates web.xml, database configuration files, the main jFinalConfig class, IndexController.java, route collection configuration class, server configuration information, and more.

2. Supports configuration files and code generation for mainstream databases like MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, H2, SQLite, PostgreSQL, etc.

3. JBolt offers a JFinal Enjoy template editor that allows simultaneous editing of HTML, JS, CSS, and JFinal template codes with template directive prompts and auto-completion.

4. JBolt offers a quick wizard to add JFinal Controller, Interceptor, Validator, Handler, and Model.

5. After installing JBolt, a customized Eclipse view for JFinal is provided, optimizing the order and position of frequently used operations and menus for a cleaner and more convenient user experience.

6. Provides automatic creation, import, and configuration file generation functions for server environments like JFinal-undertow and Jetty.

7. Both regular and Maven projects based on JFinal Undertow can be packaged into a JFinal-customized deployment structure. Maven projects use the assembly plugin, while regular projects use the specialized JFinal Packaging Tool for one-click, second-level packaging.
