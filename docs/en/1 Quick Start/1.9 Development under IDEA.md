# 1.9 Development under IDEA
### 1. Hot Reload
Both `jfinal-undertow` and `jetty-server` trigger hot reloading by monitoring whether the class file has been updated. However, by default, IDEA doesn't support automatic compilation, so its class files won't be updated during development. Hence, IDEA doesn't support hot reloading by default. You can search online to find configurations for enabling IDEA's auto-compilation feature to support hot reloading. Below are some resources:

You can also use the Shift + F9 shortcut key to start. After modifying the code, use Ctrl + F5 to restart. This method is faster than the traditional `maven jetty plugin`. Note that before using Ctrl + F5 to restart, you need to switch the focus to the debug window with Alt + 5. When developing in IDEA, try to use shortcut keys as much as possible and avoid using the mouse, as this will significantly increase development efficiency.

### 2. Multi-module
When developing with multiple modules under `jfinal undertow` using Maven, if you need to load resources across modules, you can refer here:
