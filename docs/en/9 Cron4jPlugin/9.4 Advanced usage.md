# 9.4 Advanced Usage
In addition to scheduling Java classes that implement the `Runnable` interface, you can also directly schedule external applications, such as a specific executable program under Windows or Linux. Below is a code example:

```java
String[] command = { "C:\\tomcat\\bin\\catalina.bat", "start" };
String[] envs = { "CATALINA_HOME=C:\\tomcat", "JAVA_HOME=C:\\jdks\\jdk5" };
File directory = new File("C:\\MyDirectory");
ProcessTask task = new ProcessTask(command, envs, directory);
 
cron4jPlugin.addTask(task);
me.add(cron4jPlugin);
```

As shown above, you only need to create a `ProcessTask` object and point it to a specific application. Then, by adding it via `addTask`, you can schedule it. This approach makes implementing functionalities like backing up the server database and zipping it into a ZIP file every midnight extremely simple and convenient. For more detailed usage, you can refer to the comments in the `Cron4jPlugin.java` source code.
