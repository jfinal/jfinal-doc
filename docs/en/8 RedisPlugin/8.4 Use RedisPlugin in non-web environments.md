# 8.4 Using RedisPlugin in a Non-Web Environment
RedisPlugin can also be used in non-web environments. You just need to include `jfinal.jar` and call the `redisPlugin.start()` method once. Below is a code example:

```java
public class RedisTest {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    RedisPlugin rp = new RedisPlugin("myRedis", "localhost");
    // The only difference from web usage is that you need to call the start() method here
    rp.start();
 
    Redis.use().set("key", "value");
    Redis.use().get("key");
  }
}
```

In this example, the `RedisPlugin` is initialized with the name "myRedis" and is configured to connect to a Redis server running on `localhost`. The `start()` method is explicitly called to initiate the plugin, which is the only step not typically necessary in a web environment. After that, you can use `Redis.use()` to interact with the Redis server as you would in a web application.
