# 13.1 Overview

JFinal adopts a microkernel-based, full-range extensible architecture. "Full-range" refers to the spatial expression of its extension methods. JFinal is composed of five main components: Handler, Interceptor, Controller, Render, and Plugin. This chapter will provide a brief introduction to this architecture and some commonly used extensions based on it.

## Five Main Components

1. **Handler**: Responsible for the pre-processing and post-processing of incoming HTTP requests. Handlers can be used for tasks such as URL rewriting, filtering, and more.
  
2. **Interceptor**: A mechanism that allows you to add behavior to methods inside Controllers. They can be used for logging, security checks, transactions, etc.

3. **Controller**: The core component where the business logic resides. It maps URLs to specific methods and handles client requests.

4. **Render**: Responsible for the view rendering process. JFinal supports multiple view technologies, and you can easily extend it to support others.

5. **Plugin**: Used for extending JFinal's capabilities, like adding support for databases, queues, and other services.

## Extensibility

The architecture is designed to be highly extensible, allowing developers to easily add custom functionalities or modify existing ones. Whether you need to add a custom authentication mechanism, integrate a new view rendering engine, or extend the Controller with new functionalities, JFinal's architecture makes it straightforward.

## Typical Extensions

Some of the typical extensions that can be built based on this architecture include:

1. **Custom Handlers**: For tasks like URL rewriting, request and response modification.
  
2. **Custom Interceptors**: For things like logging, security checks, or method-level annotations.
  
3. **Custom Controllers**: For implementing specific business logic or RESTful APIs.
  
4. **Custom Renders**: To integrate different view technologies other than the ones provided by default.
  
5. **Custom Plugins**: For integrating different databases, messaging queues, or any third-party libraries.

The next sections will delve deeper into these components and provide examples and best practices for extending them.
