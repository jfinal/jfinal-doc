# 11.1 Overview

JFinal provides rapid support for internationalization (i18n) with only three class files involved in its internationalization module. This makes it much easier to implement and use compared to other frameworks like Spring. JFinal's lightweight approach to i18n allows developers to easily localize their applications without dealing with the complexities often associated with larger frameworks.
