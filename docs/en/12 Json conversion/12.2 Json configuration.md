# 12.2 Json Configuration

JFinal officially provides three implementations of the `Json` abstract class: `JFinalJson`, `FastJson`, and `Jackson`. If you don't configure it, the default implementation used is `JFinalJson`. To switch to another implementation, you need to configure it in `configConstant` as follows:

```java
public void configConstant(Constants me) {
    me.setJsonFactory(new FastJsonFactory());
}
```

The above configuration switches the system default from `JFinalJson` to `FastJson`. You can also extend the `Json` abstract class and `JsonFactory` to implement a custom Json implementation.

Suppose you have extended your own `MyJson` and `MyJsonFactory`, then you can switch to your own implementation using the following method:

```java
public void configConstant(Constants me) {
    me.setJsonFactory(new MyJsonFactory());
}
```

In addition, JFinal officially provides the `MixedJson` and `MixedJsonFactory` implementations. This implementation uses `JFinalJson` for converting to JSON strings and `FastJson` for parsing back into objects.

If you wish to configure this in a non-web context, you need to use `JsonManager`. For example:

```java
JsonManager.me().setDefaultJsonFactory(new MixedJsonFactory());
```

You can also configure the format of the `Date` type after it's converted to JSON:

```java
public void configConstant(Constants me) {
    me.setJsonDatePattern("yyyy-MM-dd");
}
```

Note: When using `MixedJsonFactory`, `FastJsonFactory`, or `JacksonFactory`, you need to add their dependencies. Specific dependencies will be discussed in the next section.
