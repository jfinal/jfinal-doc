# 12.3 Four Implementations of Json

JFinal officially provides four implementations of the `Json` abstract class: `JFinalJson`, `FastJson`, `Jackson`, and `MixedJson`, which can meet most requirements.

### 1. JFinalJson

JFinalJson is the earliest implementation provided by JFinal. The most important feature of this implementation is that when converting a JFinal `Model`, it first gets the `Map attrs` attribute from the `Model` and then converts this `Map` object. Even if you have generated getter methods in your `Model`, they will not be called during conversion.

Several reasons for converting `Model.attrs` rather than using getter methods are:

A: Supports the conversion of multi-table join query results.

B: Early JFinal users did not generate getter methods for `Model`.

Note: `JFinalJson` only supports object-to-JSON-string conversion and does not support the reverse JSON-string-to-object conversion. You can use `MixedJson` to support reverse conversion: `me.setJsonFactory(new MixedJsonFactory());`.

#### Advanced Features

- Convert `Model` and `Record` field names to camel case:
  ```java
  JFinalJson.setModelAndRecordFieldNameToCamelCase();
  ```
  
- Skip null value fields during conversion:
  ```java
  JFinalJson.setSkipNullValueField(true);
  ```

- Add custom `addToJson` extension methods:
  ```java
  JFinalJson.addToJson(Timestamp.class, (value, depth, ret) -> {
      ret.addLong(((Timestamp)value).getTime());
  });
  ```
  
### 2. FastJson

FastJson is a wrapper around the third-party FastJson library. This implementation heavily depends on the getter methods of `Model` and Java beans. You can configure various FastJson conversion parameters according to its official documentation.

To use FastJson, you need to add its dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.alibaba</groupId>
    <artifactId>fastjson</artifactId>
    <version>1.2.68</version>
</dependency>
```

### 3. Jackson

This implementation is similar to `FastJson` and is a wrapper around the third-party Jackson library.

To use Jackson, you need to add its dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.fasterxml.jackson.core</groupId>
    <artifactId>jackson-databind</artifactId>
    <version>2.11.0</version>
</dependency>
```

### 4. MixedJson

`MixedJson` is another wrapper around `JFinalJson` and `FastJson`. It uses `JFinalJson` for Object-to-JSON-string conversion and `FastJson` for JSON-string-to-Object conversion. 

This implementation combines the advantages of both `JFinalJson` and `FastJson`. The former does not support JSON-string-to-Object conversion, while the latter does not support the conversion of dynamic fields in join table SQL queries.

To use `MixedJson`, you need to add the FastJson dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.alibaba</groupId>
    <artifactId>fastjson</artifactId>
    <version>1.2.68</version>
</dependency>
```
