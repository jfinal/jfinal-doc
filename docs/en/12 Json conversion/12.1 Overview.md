# 12.1 Overview

JFinal's JSON module centers around the abstract class `Json`, which is designed for easy extension with third-party implementations. JFinal officially provides three JSON implementations: `JFinalJson`, `FastJson`, and `Jackson`. All three implementations extend the abstract class `Json`.

The core abstraction of the `Json` class is as follows:

```java
public abstract class Json {
    public abstract String toJson(Object object);
    public abstract <T> T parse(String jsonString, Class <T> type);
}
```

As shown in the code above, the `Json` abstraction consists of two methods for converting between Java objects and JSON strings. The `toJson(...)` method converts any Java type to a JSON string, while the `parse` method reverses a JSON string back into an object of a specified generic type.
