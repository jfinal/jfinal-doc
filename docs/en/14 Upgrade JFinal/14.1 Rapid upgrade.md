# 14.1 Quick Upgrade

### I. Upgrading Versions Prior to jfinal 3.0
jfinal 3.0 is a major version upgrade. For upgrades from previous versions to jfinal 3.0, please refer to sections 14.2, 14.3, 14.4, and 14.5. The content in these sections is minimal, making the upgrade quite convenient.

## II. Upgrading Versions After jfinal 3.0

### 1. Upgrading to 3.1
No modifications required, smooth upgrade.

### 2. Upgrading to 3.2
`IStringSource` is renamed to `ISource`.
Follow section 14.2 for upgrading `Ret`.

### 3. Upgrading to 3.3
The `java.io.Writer` in directive extensions has been changed to `com.jfinal.template.io.Writer`. Eclipse/IDEA development tools will automatically provide prompts.

### 4. Upgrading to 3.4
Because the `defaultDatePattern` in Json has been changed from `null` to `"yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss"`, and `datePattern` attribute is removed in `JFinalJson`, you need to configure `me.setJsonDatePattern(null)` or a specific value in `configConstant(Constants me)`.

### 5. Upgrading to 3.5
`ISource.getKey()` is renamed to `ISource.getCacheKey()`.

### 6. Upgrading to 3.6
`Db` and `Model` have added an 's' suffix to `findById` and `deleteById` methods for multi-primary keys (composite primary keys), changing them to `findByIds` and `deleteByIds`.

If you are using the jfinal weixin project's `MsgController`, you need to configure `me.setMappingSuperClass(true)` in `configRoutes`.

### 7. Upgrading to 3.8
Methods using `Aop` configuration should now use `AopManager`, for example, change `Aop.addMapping(...)` to `AopManager.me().addMapping(...)`.

For those who need to quickly upgrade older projects, you can introduce `BaseController` and use the old version's implementation.

### 17. Upgrading to 4.9
