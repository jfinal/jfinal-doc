# 14.5 RenderFactory
JFinal 3.0 has undergone a complete overhaul of the render module, extracting the `IRenderFactory` interface. The original `RenderFactory` has become the default implementation of the interface, eliminating the previous `IMainRenderFactory`, `IErrorRenderFactory`, and `IXmlRenderFactory` interfaces. All extensions and customizations related to render can now be achieved by inheriting from `RenderFactory`. The 3.0 version of the render module allows for switching and customization of all renders, and the extension approach is entirely consistent. If older projects have extended `IMainRenderFactory`, they only need to be upgraded as follows:

```java
public class MyRenderFactory extends RenderFactory {
  public Render getRender(String view) {
     return new MyRender(view);
  }
}
```

Similarly, if you have previously extended `IErrorRenderFactory` or `IXmlRenderFactory`, you only need to add the `getErrorRender(...)` and `getXmlRender(...)` methods to the `MyRenderFactory` class above. After the extension, configure it in `configConstant` as follows:

```java
public void configConstant(Constants me) {
  me.setRenderFactory(new MyRenderFactory());
}
```

JFinal 3.0 adopts a completely consistent extension method for all renders, making it easier to learn, more convenient to use, and straightforward to upgrade. Additionally, the `me()` method in the original `RenderFactory` class has been discontinued. If older projects depend on this, they only need to change `RenderFactory.me()` directly to `RenderManager.me().getRenderFactory()`.
