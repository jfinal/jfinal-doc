# 14.4 baseViewPath
The setting for `baseViewPath` has been moved from the `configConstant(...)` method to the `Routes` object, and it can be set separately for different `Routes` objects. Here's an example:

```java
public class FrontRoutes extends Routes {
 
  public void config() {
    setBaseViewPath("/_view");
 
    add("/", IndexController.class, "/index");
    add("/project", ProjectController.class);
  }
}
```

The advantage of moving it from `configConstant(...)` to `configRoute(...)` is that you can set it differently for various `Routes`, reducing redundant code. Different modules may very likely have different `baseViewPath`s. The code example above is for cases where `Routes` have been broken down into smaller parts. If your application has not split the `Routes`, you can simply configure it in `configRoute` as follows:

```java
public void configRoute(Routes me) {
   me.setBaseViewPath("/_view");
 
   me.add("/", IndexController.class);
}
```
