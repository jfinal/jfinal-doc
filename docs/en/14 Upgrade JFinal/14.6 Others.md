The chained usage of `Ret.put(...).put(...)` needs to be changed to `Ret.set(...).set(...)`, as `Ret` now inherits from `HashMap`. This is done to avoid conflicts with `HashMap.put(...)`. Scenarios where `Ret.get(...)` returns a generic value should be changed to `Ret.getAs(...)`.

The `setFreeMarkerExtension` and `setVelocityExtension` methods in the `Constants` parameter of `configConstant(...)` have been uniformly changed to use the `setViewExtension` method. `setMainRenderFactory` and `setErrorRenderFactory` have been replaced by `setRenderFactory`.

The `renderXml(...)` method, which used to rely on `XmlRender` implemented with Freemarker syntax, has been changed to be implemented by the JFinal Template Engine. Projects using `renderXml(...)` will need to modify their template content.
