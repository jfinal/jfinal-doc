### 7.2 EhCachePlugin Configuration

The EhCachePlugin exists as a plugin within the JFinal framework. Therefore, to use it, you need to configure it in your `JFinalConfig` class. Below is an example code snippet for configuring the EhCachePlugin:

```java
public class DemoConfig extends JFinalConfig {
  public void configPlugin(Plugins me) {
    me.add(new EhCachePlugin());
  }
}
```

In the `DemoConfig` class, which extends `JFinalConfig`, the `EhCachePlugin` is added to the list of plugins during the configuration phase. Specifically, within the `configPlugin` method, `me.add(new EhCachePlugin());` adds a new instance of `EhCachePlugin` to JFinal's plugin system.

This simple configuration sets up EhCache as your caching solution, enabling you to leverage EhCache features in your JFinal application effortlessly.
