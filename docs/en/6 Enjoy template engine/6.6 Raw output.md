### 6.6 Raw Output

Raw output refers to a content block that is not parsed but is treated solely as plain text. Here's how it works:

```plaintext
#[[
   #(value)
   #for(x : list)
      #(x.name)
   #end
]]#
```

As shown above, raw output begins with three characters `#[[` and ends with `]]#`. The content wrapped between these characters, although directives, will still be treated as plain text. This is particularly useful for resolving conflicts with frontend JavaScript template engine directives.

Whether it's single-line comments, multi-line comments, or raw output, they all start with three characters. The purpose is to reduce the likelihood of conflicts with plain text content.

**Note**: There should be no spaces between the three control characters used for comments or raw output.
