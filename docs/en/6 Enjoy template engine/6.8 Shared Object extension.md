### 6.8 Shared Object Extension
The `addSharedObject` method allows you to add a specific object as a shared object that can be used globally. Below is a code example:

```java
public void configEngine(Engine me) {
   me.addSharedObject("RESOURCE_HOST", "http://res.jfinal.com");
   me.addSharedObject("StrKit", new com.jfinal.kit.StrKit());
}
```

In the code above, the second line adds a shared object named `RESOURCE_HOST`, while the third line adds another shared object named `StrKit`. Here's how to use them in a template:

```plaintext
<img src="#(RESOURCE_HOST)/img/girl.jpg" />
#if(StrKit.isBlank(title))
   ...
#end
```

In the first line of the example above, the output directive outputs the `RESOURCE_HOST` shared variable. For large web application systems, this approach conveniently organizes the servers where resource files are located. The second line calls the `isBlank` method of the shared object named `StrKit`. The usage is intuitive for developers.

**Note**: Since objects are shared globally, care must be taken to ensure thread safety. It is best to only share constants and stateless objects.
